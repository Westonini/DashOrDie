If I ever decide to continue this project, here were some of my ideas:

- Level select on main menu
- SecurityCamera hazard
- Spotlight (possible flickers; constantly moving in different directions)

- Hide in crates/barrels mechanic
- Level involving light/puzzles
- Replace music with own
- Create radio call-in partner character that informs the player about things.
- On death, do an animation that turns player into ghost
